# Credit_card_fraud_project
A credit_card_fraud detection project made using implementation of Logistic Regression using different modules and libraries of python
🛡️ Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Logistic Regression
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. A logistic regression algorithm was used to classify transactions as either "fraud" or "legitimate".

✅ Project Summary
A simple and effective binary classification model

Reached 100% accuracy on the test data

Used exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends in the dataset

Encoded categorical features such as:

Merchant Category

Customer Gender

Transaction Location

Visualized key patterns using heatmaps, box plots, and bar charts

📄 Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project was synthetically generated by ChatGPT. It was designed to simulate real-world credit card transactions with realistic patterns for training and testing.

🧰 Tools and Libraries
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📌 Objective
To demonstrate a basic fraud detection system using a clean dataset and classic machine learning techniques — suitable for learning, experimenting, and building upon.
